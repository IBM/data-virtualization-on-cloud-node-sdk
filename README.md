## Overview

The IBM Data Virtualization on Cloud Node.js SDK allows developers to programmatically interact with the following IBM Cloud services

## Authentication

Data Virtualization on Cloud uses token-based Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication.

With IAM authentication, you supply an API key that is used to generate an access token. Then, the access token is
included in each API request to Data Virtualization on Cloud. Access tokens are valid for a limited amount of time and must be
regenerated.

Authentication for this SDK is accomplished by
using [IAM authenticators](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-cloud-sdk-common/blob/master/README.md#authentication).

## Error-handling
